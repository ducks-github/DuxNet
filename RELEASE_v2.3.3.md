# üõ†Ô∏è DuxNet v2.3.3 Release

## Default Store Backend Config & Out-of-the-Box Fixes

This release ensures DuxNet works out-of-the-box on all platforms by including a default configuration for the store backend service.

---

## What's New

- **Added `backend/duxnet_store/config.yaml`**
  - Minimal, safe default configuration for the store backend
  - Ensures the service can start immediately after extraction
  - Users should update `secret_key` and `database` settings for production

- **Improved Out-of-the-Box Experience**
  - No more missing config errors for the store backend
  - Launcher will now start all services if files are present

---

## How to Use

2. **Extract the ZIP file**
3. **Run the setup script for your OS**
   - Windows: `scripts\setup_windows.bat`

4. **Start DuxNet**
