# DuxOS Task Engine

## Goal
The Task Engine distributes, schedules, and executes computational tasks across the Dux OS network, ensuring efficient resource use and trust in results.

## Architecture Outline
- **Task Scheduler**: Assigns tasks to nodes based on load, capability, and trust score.
- **Execution Sandbox**: Provides secure, isolated environments for running tasks.
- **Result Verifier**: Validates task results and updates node trust scores.
- **APIs**:
  - Store API: For task requests from the Store
  - Wallet API: For payment upon task completion
  - Node Registry API: For node selection and monitoring
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes tasks to optimize network performance.
- **Logging & Auditing**: Tracks all task assignments, executions, and results.

## Data Flow
1. Task request received from Store API.
2. Scheduler assigns task to suitable node(s).
3. Task runs in Execution Sandbox.
4. Result Verifier checks output and updates trust scores.
5. Payment is processed via Wallet API.
