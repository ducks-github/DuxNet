# ðŸš€ DuxNet v2.3.6 Release

## Absolute Import Fix for Models

This release fixes import errors in the backend store service by switching to absolute imports for models in service files. This ensures that `Rating`, `Review`, and `Service` are always found, regardless of how or where the code is executed.

---

## What's Fixed

- **Service files now use absolute imports for models:**
  - `from backend.duxnet_store.models import Rating, Review, Service`
- **No more `ModuleNotFoundError` for models**
- **Backend store service starts reliably on all platforms**

---
