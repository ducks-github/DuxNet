# ðŸš€ DuxNet v2.3.9 Release

## Debug Print for Desktop GUI Startup

This release adds a print statement to `desktop_manager.py` to confirm script execution and help diagnose why the desktop GUI window may not appear. This will help users and developers verify that the script is running and that the QApplication event loop is present.

## What's Added

- **Print statement at the top of `desktop_manager.py`:**
  - Prints `Starting DuxNet Desktop Manager...` when the script runs
  - Confirms script execution and helps debug GUI startup issues
- **QApplication event loop is present and correct**
