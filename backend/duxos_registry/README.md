# DuxOS Node Registry

## Goal
The Node Registry maintains the network topology, tracks node status, and manages reputation across the Dux OS network.

## Architecture Outline
- **Node Directory**: Stores information about all active nodes, including addresses, capabilities, and status.
- **Health Monitor**: Continuously checks node availability and performance.
- **Reputation Engine**: Calculates and updates node trust/reputation scores based on task results and behavior.
- **Topology Manager**: Maintains and optimizes the network structure for efficient communication.
- **APIs**:
  - Node Coordination APIs: For all modules to query/update node info
- **Security & Privacy**: Protects node data and ensures only authorized access.
- **Logging & Auditing**: Records all changes and queries for transparency.

## Data Flow
1. New node joins and registers with the Node Directory.
2. Health Monitor periodically checks node status.
3. Reputation Engine updates scores based on network activity.
4. Other modules query the registry for node selection and coordination.
