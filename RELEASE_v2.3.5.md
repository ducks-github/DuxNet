# ðŸš€ DuxNet v2.3.5 Release

## Launcher Service Detection Fix

This release fixes backend service detection by checking for the existence of the `.py` file (e.g., `main.py`, `escrow_service.py`) instead of the directory. This ensures backend services are started correctly on all platforms.

---

- **Launcher now checks for `.py` files instead of directories**
- **Backend services are detected and started on Windows, Linux, and Mac**
- **No more skipping services due to directory/file confusion**
