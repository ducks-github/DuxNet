# Dux_OS Module Development Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive step-by-step plan for building all Dux_OS modules. The plan is organized by development phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a fully functional decentralized computing platform.

## Git Workflow & Version Control

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branches for major implementations
2. **Staging**: Use `git add` to stage changes for specific features
3. **Committing**: Write descriptive commit messages with conventional commit format
4. **Pushing**: Push to GitHub after each completed feature
5. **Documentation**: Update this development plan with completion status and Git details

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

- Detailed bullet points of changes
- Files modified and their purposes
- Technical implementation notes

Closes: Issue or feature reference
```

### Version Control Best Practices
- **Branch Strategy**: main branch for stable releases, feature branches for development
- **Commit Frequency**: Commit after each logical unit of work
- **Documentation**: Update development plan with Git commit hashes and status
- **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass before committing
- **Code Review**: Self-review changes before pushing to GitHub
