# DuxOS API/App Store

## Goal
The API/App Store is a decentralized marketplace for publishing, discovering, and monetizing APIs and applications on the Dux OS network.

## Architecture Outline
- **Storefront Service**: Handles service registration, discovery, and metadata management.
- **Rating & Review System**: Allows users to rate and review APIs/apps, promoting quality and trust.
- **Distributed Metadata Storage**: Uses IPFS or DHT for decentralized storage of service metadata.
- **APIs**:
  - Task Engine API: For service execution
  - Wallet API: For payment processing
  - Discovery Protocol: For peer-to-peer service discovery
- **Search & Filter Engine**: Enables users to find services by tags, price, rating, etc.
- **Security & Verification**: Ensures authenticity of published services and user reviews.

## Data Flow
1. Developer registers API/app with metadata and pricing.
2. Metadata is distributed via decentralized storage.
3. Users discover and filter services through the Storefront.
4. Payments and access are managed via integrated APIs.
