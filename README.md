# Dux_OS
üêß Dux OS is a decentralized, Ubuntu-based Linux distribution for collaborative computing. Nodes share real-world computational tasks and monetize API/app usage using Flop Coin ‚Äî a built-in digital currency.

Dux Operating System (Dux OS)
=============================

Overview:
---------
Dux OS is a Linux-based, distributed operating system designed for collaborative computing. It connects multiple computers into a decentralized network where nodes share real-world computational tasks. Unlike traditional crypto networks that waste resources solving arbitrary hashes, Dux OS allows nodes to complete useful jobs such as processing data, running simulations, or executing APIs ‚Äî and get paid for it.

Key Features:
-------------
- Distributed computing via DuxNet
- Node-based architecture for compute sharing
- Lightweight and customizable (based on Ubuntu/Debian)
- Task scheduling, trust scoring, and fault tolerance
- Integrated Flop Coin wallet system for payments
- Monetized API/App Store

Distributed API/App Store with Flop Coin:
-----------------------------------------
Dux OS includes a decentralized API and application marketplace. Nodes can publish services and charge others Flop Coin per use.

Flop Coin:
- The native digital currency of Dux OS.
- Used for buying and selling API/app access.
- Managed through local, secure wallets.

How It Works:
-------------

1. Developer Publishes an API or App
   - Uses Dux Store dashboard to register endpoint, metadata, and price in Flop Coin.
   - Metadata is distributed via decentralized registry (e.g., IPFS, DHT).

2. User Discovers Services
   - Browses distributed app store using local UI.
   - Searches/filter by tags, price, rating.

3. Execution or API Call
   - User requests execution.
   - API or App responds with results.

4. Payment Handling
   - System deducts Flop Coin from user wallet and credits provider wallet.
   - Logs and signs each transaction.

5. Security and Trust
   - Public/private key signing.
   - Optional reputation scoring for accuracy and reliability.

Optional Enhancements:
----------------------
- Smart Contracts: Enable usage terms and refunds.
- Reputation Systems: Encourage high-quality nodes.
- CLI Access: Seamless use via terminal.
- Execution Sandbox: Secure environments for remote code.

Use Case Example:
-----------------
- Alice publishes an image upscaling API (1 Flop Coin per call).
- Bob discovers it and sends an image.
- Service executes, Bob‚Äôs wallet is debited, Alice earns.

Benefits:
---------
- Allows developers to monetize software usage.
- Encourages useful computation rather than wasteful mining.
- Builds a decentralized compute economy on Linux.
