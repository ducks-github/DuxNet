# Dux_OS
üêß Dux OS is a decentralized, Debian-based Linux distribution for collaborative computing. Nodes share real-world computational tasks and monetize API/app usage using Flop Coin ‚Äî a built-in digital currency.

Dux Operating System (Dux OS)
=============================

Overview:
---------
Dux OS is a Linux-based, distributed operating system designed for collaborative computing. It connects multiple computers into a decentralized network where nodes share real-world computational tasks. Unlike traditional crypto networks that waste resources solving arbitrary hashes, Dux OS allows nodes to complete useful jobs such as processing data, running simulations, or executing APIs ‚Äî and get paid for it.

Key Features:
-------------
- Distributed computing via DuxNet
- Node-based architecture for compute sharing
- Lightweight and customizable (based on Ubuntu/Debian)
- Task scheduling, trust scoring, and fault tolerance
- Integrated Flop Coin wallet system for payments
- Monetized API/App Store

Distributed API/App Store with Flop Coin:
-----------------------------------------
Dux OS includes a decentralized API and application marketplace. Nodes can publish services and charge others Flop Coin per use.

Flop Coin:
https://github.com/Flopcoin/Flopcoin.git
- The native digital currency of Dux OS.
- Used for buying and selling API/app access.
- Managed through local, secure wallets.

How It Works:
-------------

1. Developer Publishes an API or App
   - Uses Dux Store dashboard to register endpoint, metadata, and price in Flop Coin.
   - Metadata is distributed via decentralized registry (e.g., IPFS, DHT).

2. User Discovers Services
   - Browses distributed app store using local UI.
   - Searches/filter by tags, price, rating.

3. Execution or API Call
   - User requests execution.
   - API or App responds with results.

4. Payment Handling
   - System deducts Flop Coin from user wallet and credits provider wallet.
   - Logs and signs each transaction.

5. Security and Trust
   - Public/private key signing.
   - Optional reputation scoring for accuracy and reliability.

Optional Enhancements:
----------------------
- Smart Contracts: Enable usage terms and refunds.
- Reputation Systems: Encourage high-quality nodes.
- CLI Access: Seamless use via terminal.
- Execution Sandbox: Secure environments for remote code.

Use Case Example:
-----------------
- Alice publishes an image upscaling API (1 Flop Coin per call).
- Bob discovers it and sends an image.
- Service executes, Bob‚Äôs wallet is debited, Alice earns.

Benefits:
---------
- Allows developers to monetize software usage.
- Encourages useful computation rather than wasteful mining.


# Dux Net Payment System - High-Level Specification

## Overview

The Dux Net payment system is an integrated, decentralized escrow-based economy built into every Dux OS installation. It enables secure, automated payments using Flop Coin for API/app usage on the network, with a built-in 5% tax redirected to a community fund. When the fund reaches 100 Flop Coin, it is evenly airdropped to all verified, active Dux OS nodes.

---

## System Components

### 1. **Flop Coin Wallet Daemon (**``**)**

- Installed by default on every Dux OS node.
- Handles key generation, wallet management, sending/receiving Flop Coin.
- Provides RPC interface for interaction with other components.

### 2. **Escrow Daemon (**``**)**

- Manages temporary storage of payments when a user requests a paid API.
- Validates task completion before releasing funds.
- Distributes 95% to API developer, 5% to community fund wallet.
- Stores logs for transparency.

### 3. **Community Fund Wallet**

- Shared wallet known to all Dux OS nodes.
- Accumulates 5% tax from all paid transactions.
- Visible in the wallet GUI.

### 4. **Airdrop Service (**``**)**

- Monitors the community fund balance.
- Triggers airdrop to all verified active Dux OS nodes when balance ‚â• 100 Flop Coin.
- Uses deterministic user verification (e.g., proof of recent task completion or system heartbeat).

### 5. **Dux OS Wallet & GUI**

- Displays:
  - Wallet balance
  - Transaction history
  - Escrow activity
  - Community fund balance
  - Upcoming airdrops
- Allows user interaction with Flop Coin features and transparency tools.

### 6. **Dux Net Task Engine**

- Responsible for distributing and executing API tasks.
- Interfaces with `dux-escrowd` to initiate and confirm payments.

---

## Functional Flow

### API Transaction Example

1. User selects and calls a paid API (e.g., 10 Flop).
2. `dux-escrowd` moves 10 Flop into escrow.
3. API is executed by the provider node.
4. Upon verification:
   - 9.5 Flop sent to API provider's wallet
   - 0.5 Flop sent to community fund
5. GUI updates transaction history and displays success.

### Airdrop Trigger Flow

1. Community fund hits 100 Flop Coin.
2. `dux-airdropd` calculates eligible nodes.
3. 100 Flop divided equally among them.
4. Airdrop is logged and shown in all GUIs.

---

## Governance and Security

- Parameters like tax %, minimum airdrop, and eligibility criteria are configurable via a Dux OS governance layer.
- All transactions and fund changes are logged.
- Anti-Sybil protections can be enforced using proof of computation or heartbeat verifications.

---

## Deployment Notes

- All daemons are enabled at boot and require no user setup.
- Systemd services: `dux-flopd`, `dux-escrowd`, `dux-airdropd`.
- Logs and configs stored in `/etc/duxnet/` and `/var/log/duxnet/`.

---

## Future Considerations

- Add smart contract capability to Flop Coin for greater escrow automation.
- Implement community voting on community fund use or redistribution models.
- Integrate with other decentralized identity systems for fairer airdrop allocation.

---

# Security and Logic Considerations

The following considerations are critical for the secure and reliable operation of Dux OS and its payment system:

## Node Eligibility and Airdrop Distribution
- Node eligibility for airdrops must be clearly defined (e.g., proof of recent task completion, system heartbeat, or other verifiable activity).
- Anti-Sybil mechanisms (such as proof-of-computation or identity verification) are required to prevent malicious actors from claiming multiple airdrop shares.
- The method for dividing airdrops among eligible nodes should be deterministic and transparent.

## Fractional Flop Coin and Rounding
- All calculations involving Flop Coin (including the 5% tax) must specify how fractional values are handled (e.g., rounding rules, minimum transaction units) to avoid cumulative errors or disputes.

## Transaction Rollback and Dispute Resolution
- If an API call fails or is disputed, there must be a clear process for returning escrowed funds to the user.
- A dispute resolution mechanism should be defined for handling failed or fraudulent transactions.

## Wallet Security and Key Management
- Private keys for wallets must be encrypted at rest and never exposed in plaintext.
- Users should be encouraged to use strong passwords and backup their keys securely.

## Community Fund Wallet Security
- The community fund wallet must use multi-signature or threshold signature schemes to prevent unauthorized access.
- The private key should never be distributed or stored in a way that allows a single node to control the fund.

## API/App Store Security
- All distributed APIs/Apps must run in secure sandboxes to prevent malicious code execution on user nodes.
- Code review or automated scanning is recommended before publishing APIs/Apps to the marketplace.

## Network Security
- All communications between nodes, wallets, and daemons must be encrypted (e.g., using TLS) to prevent eavesdropping or tampering.

## Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention
- Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms to protect against spam, denial-of-service, and microtransaction attacks.

## Governance and Configurability
- The process for changing system parameters (tax %, airdrop minimums, eligibility criteria) must be transparent and require consensus or voting among stakeholders.
