# DuxOS Escrow System

## Goal
The Escrow System manages payment escrow for API transactions on the Dux OS network. It ensures secure, trustless payments between service consumers and providers by temporarily holding funds during API calls, automating distribution, and handling disputes or refunds.

## Architecture Outline
- **Escrow Manager**: Core service that creates, tracks, and resolves escrow contracts for each API transaction.
- **Wallet Integration**: Interfaces with the Wallet System to lock, release, or refund Flop Coin payments.
- **Distribution Engine**: Automatically splits payments (e.g., 95% to provider, 5% to community fund) upon successful task completion.
- **Dispute Resolver**: Handles disputes, refunds, and community arbitration if needed.
- **APIs**:
  - Wallet API: For payment operations
  - Task Engine API: To monitor task status
  - Community Fund API: For fund distribution
- **Data Storage**: Persistent storage for escrow contracts, transaction logs, and dispute records.

## Data Flow
1. API call triggers escrow contract creation.
2. Funds are locked in escrow via Wallet API.
3. Upon task completion, funds are released to provider and community fund.
4. If a dispute arises, Dispute Resolver manages resolution and possible refund.
